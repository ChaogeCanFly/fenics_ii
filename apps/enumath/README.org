* A 3d-1d coupled problem

This is a stationary version of 3d-1d coupled problem inspired by our 
[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04896). The coupling is realized using 
a surface avarageing operator over cylindrical surface that is the interface 
between the bulk domain and the vasculature. The vasculature is a random 
curve starting on the surface and then disappearing into the interior 
of a [-1, 1]^3 cube. Below is a plot of the 3d and 1d fields obtained by 
running `python has_muliplier.py` (uses 80 random points to make the curve)
