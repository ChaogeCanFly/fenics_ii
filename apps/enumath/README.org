* A 3d-1d coupled problem

This is a stationary version of 3d-1d coupled problem inspired by our 
[[https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04896]paper]. The coupling is realized using 
a surface avarageing operator over cylindrical surface that is the interface 
between the bulk domain and the vasculature. The vasculature is a random 
curve starting on the surface and then disappearing into the interior 
of a [-1, 1]^3 cube.
