* A 3d-1d coupled problem

This is a stationary version of 3d-1d coupled problem inspired by our 
[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.04896). The coupling is realized using 
a surface avaraging operator over cylindrical surface that is the interface 
between the bulk domain and the vasculature. To avoid introducing the operator 
into the diagonal block of the 3d problem (based on the radius and mesh coarseness 
the operator negatively effects the sparsity) a multiplier is introduced for 
the coupling. This comes at the prize of an extra 1d unknown.

In the scirpt, the vasculature is a random curve starting on the surface and 
then disappearing into the interior of a [-1, 1]^3 cube. Below is a plot of 
the 3d and 1d fields obtained by running `python has_muliplier.py` (uses 80 
random points to make the curve)

Alternative, `not_has_multiplier.py` solves the problem without the multiplier.
The endresult (note that the curve is different then before) looks as follows
